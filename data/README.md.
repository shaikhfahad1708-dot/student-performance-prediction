Student Performance Prediction
📘 Project Overview

This project predicts students’ final academic performance (G3) using machine learning.
The model analyzes factors such as demographic data, study habits, and previous grades to identify the key elements that most influence academic success.

🧠 Objective

To build and evaluate a regression model capable of forecasting a student’s final grade with high accuracy.

📊 Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Performance Data Set

Files Used: student-mat.csv, student-por.csv

Each file includes demographic, social, and academic data for students in Portuguese and Mathematics courses.

⚙️ Methodology

Data Preparation

Combined both datasets into one.

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Model Training

Used Random Forest Regressor for prediction.

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score (coefficient of determination)

📈 Results

R² Score: ~0.81 (81% accuracy)

MSE: ~2.9

Top Predictive Features:

G2 (Second Period Grade)

G1 (First Period Grade)

Study Time

Absences

💡 Insights

Prior grades (G1 and G2) are the strongest predictors of final results.

Consistent attendance and study time improve student outcomes.

Socioeconomic and family factors have a smaller but noticeable effect.

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
