Student Performance Prediction
📘 Overview

This project predicts students’ final academic performance (G3) using machine learning techniques.
It analyzes factors such as demographics, study habits, attendance, and previous grades to identify what most influences success.

🧠 Objective

To develop a regression model capable of accurately forecasting a student’s final grade and understanding the most important contributing factors.

📊 Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository — Student Performance Data Set

Files Used:

student-mat.csv — Math course

student-por.csv — Portuguese course

Records: 1,044 students

Features: 34 attributes (demographic, social, and academic)

⚙️ Methodology

Data Preparation

Combined both datasets and added a course column.

Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Model Building

Algorithm used: Random Forest Regressor

Framework: scikit-learn

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.91

R² Score: 0.81

📈 Results

Achieved 81% accuracy (R² = 0.81) in predicting final grades.

Most influential features:

G2 (Second Period Grade)

G1 (First Period Grade)

Study Time

Absences

“Earlier grades are the strongest predictors of student performance — confirming that continuous progress matters more than last-minute effort.”

💡 Insights

Students’ previous grades (G1, G2) are the most powerful indicators of success.

Study time and attendance also have measurable positive effects.

Parental education and social factors play smaller roles compared to consistent academic performance.

🧰 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
